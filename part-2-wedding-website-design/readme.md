# Part 2 - Wedding Website Design

Please note, I could not install Sketch onto my Windows computer (I do not have MacOS at home), so I had to use a combination of Icons8 Lunacy (Sketch file reader for Windows), and importing the PDF into GIMP (Photoshop equivalent), so I apologize in advance for any padding/margin pixel sizing discrepancies.

I also found some inconsistensies between the Sketch file and the PDF, for instance the Sketch file would not show the header for me, the mobile header seemed inconsistent between the PDF and the Sketch file, and the image was black and white on the PDF and colored on the Sketch file. I am following the PDF for final direction on styling, pertaining to the header and the image color.
